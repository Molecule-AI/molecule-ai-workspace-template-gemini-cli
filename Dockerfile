# Adapter-specific executor — owned by THIS template (universal-runtime
# refactor, molecule-core task #87 / #122). Lives alongside adapter.py
# so Python's import system picks the local /app/cli_executor.py before
# any same-named module under site-packages. Once molecule-core drops
# the file from its workspace/ package, this template becomes the sole
# source of truth (codex/ollama presets in the file are dead — neither
# has a template repo today, so the file lives here only for gemini-cli).
